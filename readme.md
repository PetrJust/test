## Synopsis

This is a simple HTML/JavaScript page that generates Hunter S. Thompson inspired insults based on a few pre-defined terms.

## Examples

You can see it in action [here]( http://technoccult.net/wp-content/uploads/gonzo-insults.html) you treacherous rabbit-punching pig.

## Motivation

This is purely a learning project. It's the first thing I've written in JavaScript, and the first thing I've published to GitHub.

## Roadmap/Contributions

Because I want to learn about GitHub, I'd love to see pull requests for additional terms added to the arrays so that I can learn how PRs work.

There are a few improvements I'd like to make, such as a better visual design, comments in the JS, and the use of external JavaScript. I know there are things that could probably be done better in the code as well. I welcome feedback and suggestions, but since this is a personal learning project the only pull requests I'm likely to accept will be additional terms.

## Contributors

Coded by Klint Finley and inspired by ailie's [original Hunter S. Thompson insult generator](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=46151), from which I stole the initial list of terms.

## Thanks

I figured out how to bolt this thing together by looking at random quote generators created by [David Nice](http://www.davidjnice.com/quote_generator.html), [CodeLifter](http://www.codelifter.com/main/javascript/randomquote.shtml) and [Code? Boom](https://codeboom.wordpress.com/sweet-resources/random-quote-generator/).
